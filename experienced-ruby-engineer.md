# Experienced Ruby Engineer #

## About Us ##
We ([Geotix](http://geotix.com/)) are a funded, nimble community driven event-ticketing company. 


We believe software is a craft that requires continual learning and improvement.
We believe that software needs to be well tested as a means to evolving it through refactoring.
We believe that good code comes from clear understanding of the domain and applying proper modeling and disciplined coding practices.
While we practice what we preach, we also know that entropy is the opposite force, and that our commitment is what keeps everything in balance.
We believe in clear open communication.
We believe in respect of everyone.
We believe that work and life need to be in balance and that sacrificing sleep does not 'make up' schedule time.

## About the Job ##
We love Ruby.
We use frameworks (Rails, Ember, React) and language extensions (Sass, Haml, CoffeeScript), but we think they belong on the outside of architecture and you shouldnâ€™t have to program in 5 languages to deliver a feature.
(We do that using [voom-presenters](https://github.com/rx/presenters), a pure ruby view layer.) 
You will work as a trusted peer on a small team to implement new features.
You will take turns leading feature releases coordinating a small team of your peers.
Although we prefer the productivity and elegance of Ruby, we have code across the whole stack.
We all are able to work on each layer in the stack, and we all fix bugs between feature releases.
We all help each other.
We use agile methods (yes really use them, not just use the tools and call it agile).

We are looking for a talented software engineer committed to his or her craft to become a key member of our small growing team.

You can work with us in our beautiful small city ([Traverse City MI](https://www.google.com/search?q=traverse+city)), or remotely. 
Remote employees must have a four or more hour overlap in work hours with the Eastern Time zone (EST/UTC-5), 
and must attend the daily stand-ups and weekly development meetings.

## Qualifications ##
* Love and (continual) mastery of Ruby
* Excellent coding and design skills 
* Experience delivering sophisticated web applications
* Strong problem solving and critical thinking skills
* Clear communication skills

## Benefits ##

Our pay is competitive and based on your experience. 
We fund attendance and participation in tech conferences and support and/or contributions to open source projects that we use or create. 
Relocation assistance is available.
