# Experienced Full Stack Ruby Engineer #

## About Us ##

We ([Geotix](http://geotix.com/)) are a funded, nimble community driven event-ticketing company. 

We believe software is a _craft_ that requires _continual learning and improvement_. We believe that software needs to be _well tested_ as a means to evolving it through _refactoring_. We believe that good code comes from _clear understanding of the domain_ and applying proper _modeling_ and _disciplined coding_ practices. While we practice what we preach, we also know that entropy is the opposite force, and that our commitment is what keeps everything in balance. We believe in _clear open communication_. We believe in _respect of everyone_. We believe that _work and life_ need to be in _balance_ and that sacrificing sleep does not 'make up' schedule time.

## About the Job ##

We work in **Ruby**, **JavaScript**, **SQL**, **CSS** and **HTML**. We use frameworks (**RoR**, **Ember**, **React**) and language extensions (**Sass**, **Haml**, **CoffeeScript**), but known they come and go. You will work as a _trusted_ peer on a small team to implement new features. We all work on each layer in the stack, and we all fix bugs between feature releases. We all help each other. We use _agile_ methods (yes really use them, not just use the tools and call it agile). We deliver features in two to four week sprints. 

We are looking for a _talented_ software engineer committed to his or her _craft_ to become a key member of our small growing team. You can work locally, in our beautiful small city ([Traverse City MI](https://www.google.com/search?q=traverse+city)), or remotely. Remote employees must have a four or more hour overlap in work hours with the eastern time zone (EST/UTC-5).
